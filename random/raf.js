//   In JavaScript, the code follows a similar structure to the Java code. We define a Life class with its corresponding methods. Then, we create an instance of the Life class using the new keyword and call the startLife() method on the myLife object.

// The while loop continues as long as the condition !myLife.makeSuccess() is true. Inside the loop, the tryAgain() method is called on the myLife object. The if statement checks the condition myLife.death(). If the condition is true, the break statement is executed, ending the loop.

// Please note that the code assumes you will fill in the necessary logic within the methods of the Life class for it to function as intended.
